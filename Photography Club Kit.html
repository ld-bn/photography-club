           Taking photos is an activity in which we use a camera to capture moments in our life. Since the first actual photographic camera, capable of capturing a permanent image, was developed in the early 19th century, the photography industry began to develop strongly until today. Now, there are many different genres of photography such as landscape photography, people photography, event photography, photography for documentation or art and each type has a dissimilar way to take photos, even each photographer has their individual style to take photos.        </p>

        <p class="about-text paragraph-2">
           The aim of this project is to propose and found a photography club where everyone is free to be creative and take photos according to their interests and passions. It is also a place for many students to connect to each other who have the same hobby as them. </p><p>


 </p><p class="about-2">What is Photography?</p>

 <p class="about-text paragraph-3">
Taking photos is an activity in which we use a camera to capture moments in our life. Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. Since the first actual photographic camera, capable of capturing a permanent image, was developed in the early 19th century, the photography industry began to develop strongly until today. Now, there are many different genres of photography such as landscape photography, people photography, event photography, photography for documentation or art and each type has a dissimilar way to take photos, even each photographer has their individual style to take photos. </p><p>


</p><p class="about-3">Why has photography become important? </p>

 <p class="about-text paragraph-4">
        Since the advent of the digital camera, called the camera obscura, people have recognized the importance of recording images. The first permanent photograph was captured in 1826 (some sources say 1827) by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in France. It shows the roof of a building lit by the sun. You can see it reproduced:</p><p>

 </p><p class="about-text paragraph-5">
And until now,  It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication. Modern photography has raised a number of concerns on its effect on society. In Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954), the camera is presented as promoting voyeurism. 'Although the camera is an observation station, the act of photographing is more than passive observing. </p><p>

</p><p class="about-text paragraph-6">
Photography is one of the new media forms that changes perception and changes the structure of society. One of the practices through which photography constitutes society is tourism. Tourism and photography combine to create a "tourist gaze in which local inhabitants are positioned and defined by the camera lens. However, it has also been argued that there exists a "reverse gaze" through which indigenous photographers can position the tourist photographer as a shallow consumer of images. </p><p>



    
        </p><h2 class="new-section-title-1">Meaning of photography</h2>


<p class="about-text paragraph-7">

Photos are not just for photographers, it also can spread a lot of meaning and emotions to even those who see it. In my point of view, all the photos represent our appreciation for those memories, because we love those memories so we take photos to preserve them longer. Moreover, I think that because the object is special, we take pictures of it, but each scene has its own specialness. To see through that specialness and honor it in the photo, everything depends on the ability of each photographer. </p><p>

</p><p class="about-text paragraph-8">

This world is truly beautiful and photography is also a form of art that pursues that beauty. Each photographer will have their own characteristic and the way they realize this world is really different through their lens. By seeing their photos, we can see how they perceive the world. That is the reason why I love taking photos. </p><p>

</p><p class="about-text paragraph-10">

A photography club is a place where students with similar interests in taking photos gather. Not just sharing their own images together, but they can also learn more skills from each other, find someone to take photos with or even organize events together. Moreover, the photography club in Pierce can also capture moments in many events at Pierce to color the student experience in their study life. </p><p>


</p><h4 class=" new-section-title-3"> What is the different between taking photography in club and in individual? </h4> 

 <p class="about-text paragraph-11">
Taking photographs in a club or group setting versus working individually offers different experiences and advantages: </p><p>

 </p><p class="about-4">Social Interaction and Learning</p>


<p class="about-text paragraph-12">

Club Setting: In a photography club, you are surrounded by other photographers with varying skills and styles. This environment can foster learning and inspiration as you share techniques, exchange feedback, and discuss ideas. Clubs often provide workshops, photo walks, and guest speakers that can enhance your skills and expand your network. </p><p>

</p><p class="about-text paragraph-13">
Individual Setting: When photographing on your own, you may encounter fewer direct, real-time opportunities for collaborative learning or immediate feedback that a group or club environment provides. However, there are still many valuable ways to enhance your skills and deepen your knowledge independently.
 </p><p>

</p><p class="about-5">Creativity and Style</p>

<p class="about-text paragraph-14">
Club Setting: In a club, creative ideas can multiply. Group challenges, themed shoots, or collaborations often inspire photographers to try new subjects or techniques they might not have considered alone. </p><p>

	<img src="./Photography Club Kit_files/462545700_556635687098377_7503097948878700326_n.jpg" alt="C:\Users\DELL\Downloads\462545700_556635687098377_7503097948878700326_n.jpg" style="display: block; margin: auto; width=" 450"="" height="500">




</p><p class="about-text paragraph-15">
Individual Setting: Working solo allows for complete creative freedom and control. You can fully immerse yourself in your personal style without external influence, often leading to a more introspective or unique approach. </p><p>

</p><p class="about-6">Feedback and Improvement</p>
<p class="about-text paragraph-16">
Club Setting: Photography clubs often provide group critique sessions where members can present their work and receive constructive feedback from others. This feedback can be incredibly valuable for personal and artistic growth, as it highlights areas for improvement and gives you a fresh perspective on your work. Often, other members notice details or subtleties that you may have missed. This collaborative critique process helps photographers become more aware of their strengths and weaknesses, providing insights that can be applied to future projects and ultimately leading to a higher quality of work.
 </p><p>

<img src="./Photography Club Kit_files/460091912_1970475473375340_6797424063256125910_n.jpg" alt="C:\Users\DELL\Pictures\460091912_1970475473375340_6797424063256125910_n.jpg" style="display: block; margin: auto; width=" 600"="" height="450">



</p><p class="about-text paragraph-17">
Individual Setting: When working alone, the opportunity for feedback is generally more limited, as you don’t have the instant input that a group setting provides. However, many online communities, photography forums, and social media groups can offer valuable critiques and guidance.
 </p><p>

</p><p class="about-7">Opportunities and Exposure</p>
<p class="about-text paragraph-18">
Club Setting: Clubs often participate in exhibitions, contests, and community projects, offering members a chance to showcase their work, gain recognition, and build a portfolio. </p><p>

</p><p class="about-text paragraph-15">
Individual Setting: Solo photographers may need to seek opportunities on their own, which can be challenging without networking. However, being independent gives you more control over which opportunities to pursue. </p><p>


</p><p class="about-8">Motivation and Accountability</p>

<p class="about-text paragraph-19">

Club Setting: Clubs often have regular meetings, photo contests, and assignments, which help keep members motivated and focused on improving. Accountability to a group can encourage you to practice consistently. </p><p>

</p><p class="about-text paragraph-20">

Individual Setting: Without the structure of a club, motivation can be more challenging to maintain. However, self-driven photographers often develop strong discipline and personal practice. </p><p>


</p><h3 class="new-section-title-4">Conclusion</h3>

<img src="./Photography Club Kit_files/462551838_873105588289536_7284755982596989322_n.jpg" alt="C:\Users\DELL\Downloads\462551838_873105588289536_7284755982596989322_n.jpg" style="display: block; margin: auto; width=" 450"="" height="500">


<p class="about-text paragraph-21">
In summary, joining a club offers a structured, collaborative environment conducive to growth, feedback, and social networking. Meanwhile, working individually provides the freedom to explore and develop a personal style at your own pace. Many photographers benefit from combining both approaches. </p><p>
